# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## What is Handwritten Digit Recognition?
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.  
It is a challenging task for machines because handwritten digits are often imperfect and can have many variations.  
Handwritten digit recognition solves this problem by using image processing and deep learning techniques to identify digits in images.

## About the Python Deep Learning Project
In this project, we will implement a **handwritten digit recognition app** using the **MNIST dataset**.  
We will use a special type of deep neural network called **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  
At the end of the project, we will build a **GUI** that allows users to draw a digit and get real-time recognition results.

## Prerequisites
This Python project requires:
- Basic knowledge of **Python programming**.
- Understanding of **deep learning** concepts.
- Familiarity with **Keras** for model building.
- Knowledge of **Tkinter** for GUI development.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow keras pillow
